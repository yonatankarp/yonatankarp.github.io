title: Hello World!

So I set up the blog and not it’s up and running!

My main plan is to write a blog for the people who just finished university and doing their first steps into the real-world.

I remember that after my 4 years of studies CS I felt like a champ, like I’m ready to face anything! This feeling changed pretty fast into “I don’t know what I’m doing…” and “what did they actually teach us over there?!”, "Why nobody ever talked to us about good practices for coding?". 

The truth is that there is a huge gap between learning to write code at the university and what is actually required by the industry, and this gap getting bigger and bigger every year. In this blog, I hope to close as this gap as much as possible (at least by showing you want you don’t know that you don’t know…)
