Hi all,
My name is Yonatan and I'm a backend engineer at [SumUp](https://sumup.com/) (mustly with Java). Previously I worked at [Nice Ltd.](https://www.nice.com/) in thier "Customer Journey Solutions" department - or CJS for short - using mostly Java, Python and a bit of Scala. later on I worked there as part a remote team working on (Nexidia)[https://www.nice.com/engage/nexidia-customer-engagement-analytics/]'s product (using C#).
Previous to that I worked at [Inuitive](http://www.inuitive-tech.com/) - a mid-level startup located in Israel as part of the calibration software team.  


### More Information
A few months ago I've relocated to [Berlin](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=berlin&ia=web&iax=about&iaxm=maps) with my wife and our cat to start a new adventure, and just a short time after we already adopted our 2nd cat here!
